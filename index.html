						style="width:auto;height:300px;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" /></span>
				<p>Currently interning at Hyperface as a SDE Intern, and am pursuing a Bachelors in Technology in
					Computer
					Science Engineering at VIT Vellore (set to graduate in August, 2024). I aim to
					specialize in Software Engineering and Development and Product Management. </p>

				<p><b>Current Aim:</b> To gain valuable knowledge in the field of Computer Science Engineering, in
					important sub fields like Systems Programming, Full-Stack Software Development, End-to-end Software
					Planning and
					Team-based Collaboration, and to build amazing things through code!
				</p>

				<!-- <p>Current Skillset: My skillset was mostly defined by the course I had taken up until the end of my
					second year. I had
					completed important courses like Object-oriented programming, Operating systems, Web mining,
					Database management systems,
					Software Engineering, Data Visualization, Machine learning, etc. My personal projects were mostly
					subsidiaries from research
					papers and hackathons that I had worked on. I had only theoretical knowledge of making dynamic
					server-side web-pages,
					but practical knowledge on Design and development of Front-end Systems using ReactJs. I had begun
					working on small back-end
					projects to better improve my understanding of API development and Database Management. I had
					knowledge in Python Application
					Development as I had done a project on Data Mining. I was also familiar with ML and Data Analytic
					related Tech stacks,
					like R, Matlab and Python. As far as interview preparation and Competitive Coding, I used Java, even
					though I am familiar
					with C/C++, mostly due the fact that I had been learning Java since the 8th grade. And so, out of
					habit, Java has
					remained my primary coding language. I also had some theoretical knowledge in IoT based systems,
					including implementations
					of Zigbee based systems. This came out of interest of my field, Computer Science Engineering with
					Specialization in IoT.
					Other than that, I had been actively working on JavaScript to better improve my knowledge in
					ReactJs.</p>
