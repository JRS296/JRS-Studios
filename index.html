				<h2 class="major">About</h2>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/pp.jpg" alt=""
						style="width:auto;height:300px;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" /></span>
				<p>Currently pursuing a Bachelors in Technology in Computer Science Engineering in VIT Vellore, aim to
					specialize
					in Software Development and Product Management. Also interested in gaining work experience in web
					development, AI/ML and IoT Systems. Actively looking for opportunities to work in the field of CS
					Engineering.</p>

				<p>Aim: To gain valuable knowledge in the field of Computer Science Engineering, in important sub fields
					like Software
					Planning, Software Development, Front End and Back End Development, Database Management and
					Team-based Collaboration;
					to gain experience and exposure in a real time work environment; to establish and make new
					connections with my peers
					and co-workers; and to overall better understand how I best function within a work environment, to
					establish both my
					strengths and my weaknesses, and how to better handle both in the context of a work environment.
				</p>

				<!-- <p>Current Skillset: My skillset was mostly defined by the course I had taken up until the end of my
					second year. I had
					completed important courses like Object-oriented programming, Operating systems, Web mining,
					Database management systems,
					Software Engineering, Data Visualization, Machine learning, etc. My personal projects were mostly
					subsidiaries from research
					papers and hackathons that I had worked on. I had only theoretical knowledge of making dynamic
					server-side web-pages,
					but practical knowledge on Design and development of Front-end Systems using ReactJs. I had begun
					working on small back-end
					projects to better improve my understanding of API development and Database Management. I had
					knowledge in Python Application
					Development as I had done a project on Data Mining. I was also familiar with ML and Data Analytic
					related Tech stacks,
					like R, Matlab and Python. As far as interview preparation and Competitive Coding, I used Java, even
					though I am familiar
					with C/C++, mostly due the fact that I had been learning Java since the 8th grade. And so, out of
					habit, Java has
					remained my primary coding language. I also had some theoretical knowledge in IoT based systems,
					including implementations
					of Zigbee based systems. This came out of interest of my field, Computer Science Engineering with
					Specialization in IoT.
					Other than that, I had been actively working on JavaScript to better improve my knowledge in
					ReactJs.</p> -->
